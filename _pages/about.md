I am a bachelor student in Computer Science at the University of Parma, in the Department of Mathematical, Physical, and Computer Sciences.

# Short Bio
I am currently graduating with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Parma. Before starting my Computer Science studies, I attended a year at the Faculty of Mathematics (2020-2021) at the same university. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong interest in Software Verification, particularly in Static Analysis by Abstract Interpretation.
