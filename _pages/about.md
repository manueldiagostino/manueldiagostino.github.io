I am a master's student in Computer Science at the University of Parma, in the Department of Mathematical, Physical, and Computer Sciences.

# Short Bio
I am currently a master's student in Computer Science at the University of Parma. My primary academic interests lie in Software Verification, particularly in Static Analysis by Abstract Interpretation. During my internship, I worked on integrating the [PPLite](https://github.com/ezaffanella/PPLite) library into the [Mopsa](https://mopsa.lip6.fr/) static analyzer, further enhancing my practical experience and technical skills in this field. My bachelor's thesis focused on evaluating the quality of source code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) through static analysis.
